###### What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go well in relation to the last stage evaluation?
We were able to add textures and animate the game to make it look a lot less like a prototype. We kept our initial game name “Dungeon Disco” and added a disco ball at the end to build off that name.

###### What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go wrong in relation to the last stage evaluation?
It went relatively smooth because we checked each others work. This allowed us to catch some untextured parts of the level. The biggest issue maybe our inexperience with Git and GitHub.

###### How were the previous evaluations wrapped into this latest stage?

###### What would you do differently to improve the process?
It would have been nice to set up a Kanban Board to track progress on features.

###### Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your project development? Why?
This issue tracker was not super useful because this project took place over just a few weeks. We ended up resolving most issues as we came across them.

###### What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go well in relation to the last stage evaluation?
	Our iterative testing process and feature verification went smoothly. By using pull requests and locally testing  
	each branch before merging, we maintained high code quality and reduced conflicts.  
	The testing checklist continued to be a reliable guide for ensuring systematic feature validation.  
	Communication during weekly meetings helped us stay aligned and provided clarity on tasks and progress.  

###### What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go wrong in relation to the last stage evaluation?
	While our testing process was effective, we encountered delays due to unclear ownership of some tasks.  
	Occasionally, features were tested late due to prioritization shifts, which introduced minor bottlenecks.  
	We also noted that the testing checklist did not account for some edge cases, leading to gaps in testing.  

###### How were the previous evaluations wrapped into this latest stage?
	Feedback from the previous evaluation emphasized the importance of a structured workflow, which we  
	continued to refine. The use of pull requests, feature branches, and testing checklists were incorporated  
	more consistently. Additionally, communication about task ownership improved slightly, though it  
	remains an area for further optimization.  

###### What would you do differently to improve the process?
	- **Refine Task Ownership:** Establish clearer task ownership by assigning specific team members to features  
	  or components. This could prevent delays and confusion.  
	- **Expand the Testing Checklist:** Include additional test cases, particularly for edge cases and scenarios  
	  that emerged during development.  
	- **Implement Scrum-like Techniques:** Although the project is small, a simplified Scrum process with  
	  acceptance criteria and tracking could enhance clarity and accountability.  

###### Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your project development? Why?
	While the testing checklist and GitHub tools were effective, we still found the lack of a Scrum board or  
	other visual tracking system to be a gap. Direct task assignments worked well for the project’s size but  
	became less effective as the project evolved. In hindsight, introducing a lightweight version of Scrum  
	or a Kanban board could have better supported the team’s organization and communication.

###### What parts of the testing process did the team perceive go well?
	The iterative playtesting during feature implementation was highly effective.  
	By testing incrementally, we were able to catch bugs early, reducing the complexity of fixes later.  
	The testing checklist streamlined the process, ensuring all features were verified systematically.  
	Specifically, we made pull requests where branches were tested locally before merging, adding an additional  
	layer of validation. This process also allowed us to gather feedback and learn from one another, enhancing  
	both collaboration and feature quality.  

###### How were bugs identified and corrected?
	Bugs were tracked using Unreal Engine's internal error logs and debug tools. Although we haven't needed  
	to log any major issues in GitHub yet, smaller issues were resolved during pull requests.  
	We also utilized print statements to validate blueprint functionality during development, helping identify  
	and resolve minor bugs efficiently.  

###### In terms of the QA and testing process, what would you do differently to improve the process?
	We would have used the Scrum board to create tickets with acceptance criteria for better organization.  
	While our process worked well for this small project, a larger project might face scalability issues.  
	Another area for improvement would be communication: While GitHub was effective for logging bugs,  
	clearer communication about bug assignments and status updates could further streamline the process.  

###### What tools (chosen in Module Two) did you find successful in the development of your Alpha project? Why?
	Testing Checklist: The checklist ensured that every feature was tested systematically, reducing the chance  
	of missing critical functionality.  
	Game Engine Debugging Tools: Unreal Engine's built-in debugging tools were invaluable for identifying runtime  
	errors and performance issues, particularly during final playtests.  
	Feature Branching: Using feature branches and verifying each branch before merging ensured smooth integration  
	and reduced conflicts, making the process efficient for our team.  

###### Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your project development? Why?
	We did not use the Scrum board. While we recognize its potential for larger projects, the small scope and  
	limited timeline made it unnecessary. Splitting and assigning tasks directly worked well for this project.  
	However, a Scrum board could significantly improve communication and feature definition in larger projects.  

###### How did the team approach to the initial analysis of the game design document contribute to the decision 
###### to use these tools and techniques?
	The thorough analysis of the game design document allowed us to identify core gameplay mechanics, features,  
	and potential risks early. This clarity guided the selection of tools like GitHub for issue tracking and the  
	structured checklist for feature validation. For a smaller project, using simple, effective tools aligned  
	with our timeline and goals. This approach ensured our QA efforts were efficient without adding unnecessary  
	complexity.

###### Develop a plan for quality assurance and testing your product. In your plan, be sure to include the following:
###### How will you test objects, levels, and games during the development cycle? Develop a schedule and include:
###### Play Test: Testing during the preproduction stage
	We plan to play test as we add features to verify they work. This is also allow us to log bugs and gather feedback
	on the core gameplay mechanics. On Sunday, before submitting milestones Alpha, we will do a final play test to verify 
	all features using the testing checklist.
     
###### Demo: Testing before marketing will demo the project
	The Saturday before the Beta release is when the demo testing will start and the focus will be identifying and 
	remediation of major bugs, checking features are complete, and everything is textured.
     
###### Code Release: Checking the code release demo with the test plan
	This final testing should occur on the Saturday before our Final submission. Game will be verified against 
	Rubric and Our current testing plan to maintain completeness and all high-priority bugs fixed.
     
###### What items will be tested? Include a checklist of items to be tested (pass/fail).
	Each feature will be tested by Pass/Fail or CNT (could not test)

###### How will you update the test plan to reflect changes to the game and design document?
	All features will be checked during our weekly meetings on Wednesday. If changes are made, the test plan 
	should be updated to reflect those changes. On Fridays, the test checklist will be evaluated to ensure it 
	aligns with the current goals.
###### How will bugs be reported?
	This project will use the Issues tracker on GitHub to log bugs. One sample bug will be added as a template 
	to follow. Information to include for logging a bug is as follows: Severity level (Crash, critical, minor), 
	priority, current status, version, category (art, design, engineering), Component that was affected, description, 
	screenshot, and crash log files.

###### How will the bugs and their changes be tracked over time?
	Bugs will be tracked in the log. They will be assigned by priority and marked “in progress”. Upon completion, 
	they will be saved as documentation and marked “Complete”.
