###### Project Log Module Three
###### Develop a plan for quality assurance and testing your product. In your plan, be sure to include the following:
###### How will you test objects, levels, and games during the development cycle? Develop a schedule and include:
###### Play Test: Testing during the preproduction stage
	We plan to play test as we add features to verify they work. This is also allow us to log bugs and gather feedback on the core gameplay mechanics. On Sunday, before submitting milestones Alpha, we will do a final play test to verify all features using the testing checklist.
     
###### Demo: Testing before marketing will demo the project
	The Saturday before the Beta release is when the demo testing will start and the focus will be identifying and remediation of major bugs, checking features are complete, and everything is textured.
     
###### Code Release: Checking the code release demo with the test plan
	This final testing should occur on the Saturday before our Final submission. Game will be verified against Rubric and Our current testing plan to maintain completeness and all high-priority bugs fixed.
     
###### What items will be tested? Include a checklist of items to be tested (pass/fail).

###### How will you update the test plan to reflect changes to the game and design document?
	All features will be checked during our weekly meetings on Wednesday. If changes are made, the test plan should be updated to reflect those changes. On Fridays, the test checklist will be evaluated to ensure it aligns with the current goals.
###### How will bugs be reported?
	This project will use the Issues tracker on GitHub to log bugs. One sample bug will be added as a template to follow. Information to include for logging a bug is as follows: Severity level (Crash, critical, minor), priority, current status, version, category (art, design, engineering), Component that was affected, description, screenshot, and crash log files.

###### How will the bugs and their changes be tracked over time?
	Bugs will be tracked in the log. They will be assigned by priority and marked “in progress”. Upon completion, they will be saved as documentation and marked “Complete”.
