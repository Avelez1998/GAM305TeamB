###### What parts of the testing process did the team perceive go well?
	The iterative playtesting during feature implementation was effective. 
	By testing incrementally, we were able to catch bugs early, reducing 
	the complexity of fixes later. The use of our testing checklist streamlined 
	the process, ensuring all features were verified systematically. Specifically, 
	we made pull requests, branches were pulled down to local and verified 
	as part of the testing process. This also was a chance to gather some feedback
	and learn from one another.
     
###### How were bugs identified and corrected?
	When bugs are identified, they are added to GitHub's issue tracker. We 
	have not had issues to log yet. We have identified bugs with unreals internal 
	error log, but we have not had any serious bugs. All issues were resolved 
	during pull requests. We used print statements to verify as we created blueprints.

###### In terms of the QA and testing process, what would you do differently to improve the process?
	We would have use the scrum board to make tickets with acceptance criteria. But this project was 
	small. Our team did utilize our feature list to make sure we tested all features periodically. 
	Our system seems to be working well on this scale, but any larger and we might start running 
	into issue. Another way we could improve would be to improve communication: Although GitHub 
	was effective for logging bugs, clearer communication about bug assignment and status updates 
	could have further streamlined the process. Since it was a small project we are working on, 
	we would not rely too much on SCRUM.
     
###### What tools (chosen in Module Two) did you find successful in the development of your Alpha project? Why?
	Testing Checklist: The checklist ensured that every feature was tested systematically, reducing the chance 
	of overlooking key functionality. Game Engine Debugging Tools: Built-in debugging tools helped identify 
	runtime errors and performance issues, particularly during final playtests. Finally, feature branching to 
	verify each branch before merging. Double checking made the process very smooth for our team.
	
###### Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your project development? Why?
	We did not use the SCRUM board. We recognized the usefulness of this tool, however, the list of features was easily
	split up and assigned and we had time constraints that made it not be worth the resources to implement. Given a project
	any larger with a little more time, this would have been a excellent way to improve communication and better define features.

###### How did the team approach to the initial analysis of the game design document contribute to the decision 
###### to use these tools and techniques?
	The thorough analysis of the game design document allowed us to identify core gameplay mechanics, 
	features, and potential risks early. This guided the selection of tools like GitHub for issue 
	tracking and the structured checklist for feature validation. The clarity from the design document 
	also helped us prioritize critical features, aligning our QA efforts with project goals. 
    and for a smaller project, it just made sense to use what was available and easy.

###### Develop a plan for quality assurance and testing your product. In your plan, be sure to include the following:
###### How will you test objects, levels, and games during the development cycle? Develop a schedule and include:
###### Play Test: Testing during the preproduction stage
	We plan to play test as we add features to verify they work. This is also allow us to log bugs and gather feedback
	on the core gameplay mechanics. On Sunday, before submitting milestones Alpha, we will do a final play test to verify 
	all features using the testing checklist.
     
###### Demo: Testing before marketing will demo the project
	The Saturday before the Beta release is when the demo testing will start and the focus will be identifying and 
	remediation of major bugs, checking features are complete, and everything is textured.
     
###### Code Release: Checking the code release demo with the test plan
	This final testing should occur on the Saturday before our Final submission. Game will be verified against 
	Rubric and Our current testing plan to maintain completeness and all high-priority bugs fixed.
     
###### What items will be tested? Include a checklist of items to be tested (pass/fail).
	Each feature will be tested by Pass/Fail or CNT (could not test)
 	Feature Test Checklist

	Player power-ups/pickups:
		-Health
		-Double damage
		-Shooting speed boost
  		-Invisible potion
	Moving enemies:
 		-Shooter/Archer
   		-Homing explosive enemies
	Stationary enemies:
 		-Turret
   		-Bomb thrower
	Obstacles/traps:
		-Pit trap
		-Pressure plate trap
  		-Closing spike wall
	
###### How will you update the test plan to reflect changes to the game and design document?
	All features will be checked during our weekly meetings on Wednesday. If changes are made, the test plan 
	should be updated to reflect those changes. On Fridays, the test checklist will be evaluated to ensure it 
	aligns with the current goals.
###### How will bugs be reported?
	This project will use the Issues tracker on GitHub to log bugs. One sample bug will be added as a template 
	to follow. Information to include for logging a bug is as follows: Severity level (Crash, critical, minor), 
	priority, current status, version, category (art, design, engineering), Component that was affected, description, 
	screenshot, and crash log files.

###### How will the bugs and their changes be tracked over time?
	Bugs will be tracked in the log. They will be assigned by priority and marked “in progress”. Upon completion, 
	they will be saved as documentation and marked “Complete”.
